# Anudaan: Crowd Fundraising Platform - Powered by Ethereum Blockchain

Fundraising has become a powerful method for raising money, whether it's for health causes, educational initiatives, or supporting startups. However, trust and transparency in traditional fundraising platforms have been major concerns. To address these issues, we have developed a Decentralized Application (DApp) using Ethereum Blockchain technology. Our platform stores campaign details, contributions, withdrawal requests, and funds on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and eliminating the possibility of fraud or misuse.


## Problem Statement & Necessity
Fundraising is really a boon for the people in need but there are a lot of flaws in the process that need to be solved for it to work and manifest its full potential in helping people.

The major flaws with the current fundraising platforms are: 
- Security: Online crowdfunding leaves contributors susceptible to fraud because traditional legal and reputation security measures may not work. But blockchain, which cannot be compromised due to its immutability, can offer that level of security
- Transparency: There has been this trend in crowdfunding platforms around the world where people have been having a hard time knowing that their money was sent to where they intended it to go. 
- Global contribution: Some blockchain-based crowd-based forums are for a particular country, making it difficult for donors to participate in various campaigns. Using the blockchain anyone in the world can contribute to the campaign. Transactions are quick and easy.
- Earning Trust: There have been cases whereby some people have run such fraudulent campaigns that after getting funded, they go away with the money they were given.
